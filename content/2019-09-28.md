The most of difference between S3RS and other S3 clients is the shell interface.  

Because I often to change s3 configure file and connect to different S3 storage cluster in my work.

the shell interface is easy for me to switch s3 connection with different S3 storage cluster.

Recently, there are other people using my S3 client and request a command-line interface,

so I implement this as the first priority.

Now, S3RS is easy to use as a command line interface tool or a shell interface tool.

This is an example for original usage with S3RS.

Here, you can see the command line interface of S3RS.

Futhermore, the parameter of `--config=` can be a full path of a configure file or the filename of the configure under `~/.config/s3rs`.
