## NoDoorBell

I am living in an apratment. The building is old, and the doorbell of the building is broken. Some people live in the same building do not want to buy a new door bell, thus I make this virtual doorbell for me. I post a QR code, which direct to the specific web page, on the wall near the front door of the apartment. When the specific web page loading, the http server in my home will play the door bell sound, so as to notify me.
