S3 is object storage, the object is easy addressed by `bucket` and `key`.

People still use `/` in the key, but there is no folder concept in the `key` part.

However, key in the `s3://bucket/key` to specify the object is normal but verbose.

So, the way to address an object can be much easier.

As you can see, these styles, `s3://bucket/key`, `/bucket/key`, and `bucket/key`, 
to address an object is aceptable in S3RS.
