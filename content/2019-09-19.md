This picture is taken at the "school main entrance" of this river.  
The school main entrance means that means there will be a new world after the climber over it.
Climbing over the small waterfall is not really hard, but it still needs faith.
There are several moments the climber may afraid, first is at the first sight of the waterfall, 
hearing the sounds and feeling the water splashed on the face. second is the moment climbing on and leaving the pool.
When leaving the pool, the body is very heavy because of wet and losing buoyancy.
The last also the most is when on the top of the wall because there is the longest distance climber may fall.  


This month I leave my comfort zone because I still try to my destiny.  
I am like to learn new things and not easy to comprise with legacy technologies.
Give up what I accumulate, and start to search is just like the first moment to see the waterfall, and try to leave the pool.
I know there will be a period I need to bear the heave things in my life,  and I still need to face another much difficult in the future.
Maybe I will be afraid. 
However, I put myself in this situation and I know when these overcome I will be better and excellent.
