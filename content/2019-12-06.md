The title is `It is an Eperanto input method`.

These days, I am interested in Esperanto.
I know this may not really help to communicate with the world at this moment.
However, it is really idealism with a great heart.
I appreciate this idea and start my trip to [lernu!](https://lernu.net/).

Besides,  I made an Esperanto keyboard for my favorite input method, [HIME](https://github.com/hime-ime/hime).
Here is the [PR](https://github.com/hime-ime/hime/pull/587), if you like to know how it works.

The basic idea follows the Android google keyboard. 
Because `q`, `w`, `x`, `y` are not used in Esperanto, we reuse this key and let a similar Esperanta alphabet nearby the English alphabet.  
For example, the `ĉ` is taken the place `x`, 
because there is no `x` in Esperanto, and the key `x` is nearby `c` in QWERT layout.
Futhermore, there are only three phrase with `ĥ` in Esperanto, we use `ŭ` for the key `y`.

In addition, I add a prefix method, if someone really forgets the Esperanto layout. 
You can key in  `^` and `g`, and the input method will change the letter into `ĝ`.  Because `^` is the special prefix key if you want to input pure `^` with this input method, you just key in it twice. 


Here is the special mapping.

- q -> ŝ
- w -> ĝ
- x -> ĉ
- y -> ŭ
- ; -> ĵ
- ^h -> ĥ
-  ^^ -> ^

This is an example of output for the input method.

I use the green star symbol for the input method icon showing in the system tray because is proposed in 1892 according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_symbols).
