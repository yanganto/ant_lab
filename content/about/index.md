Hi, 

My name is Antonio. I am from Taiwan. Coding, building and outdoor activities are my favorites.  

More particularly, I love to use Rust and Linux(NixOS) for a while. My laptops are using niri with bar-rs and leftwm with polybar and a nixos server for websites and next cloud for simple photo sharing, I am using manual script and highly rely on nixos modules to sharing configurations for all the machines, so I can keep using different machines and still keep the similar working flow.  If there are any exciting side projects, I am happy to join, and happy to do much deeper with kernel or drivers if something I can do.

I have a van in Taiwan, and it is customized with a battery, solar plate, water tank with heater, shower, projector, refrigerator and a little wood work, so that it is easier to access outdoor activities.  I was a hiking instructor in a club majoring in map reading. I am an ordinary rock climber with ability less than 5.10a/b, but have enough knowledge to do trad climbing with the industrial first level rope access technician certificate. If you need a good belayer or an end man of a rope team to recycle I can do that.  Recently, I tried to learn more about water activities, such as diving, surfing.  I have an open water scuba diving instructor licence of SDI, meanwhile with PADI dive master,  Molchanovs wave 1 for free divers and YHS system maintenance certificate for diving gears.  I can do side mount well but not DPV for now.

There is a special background and a little private from me, if you are still reading, I am happy to share.  My master degree is Chemistry, and I got hodgkin lymphoma when I was in the lab working on my thesis.  I did several chemo therapy, radiation therapy and a bone marrow transplant.  I am cured with struggles, and this is an important thing in my life.  So I love to keep exploring and learning in my life, and sometimes more focus on the moment and moving forward are better than a plane with total details.   Also, if things are reasonable I love to help people.

Thanks for reading here.  This is all about me.  Happy to learn from you also.
