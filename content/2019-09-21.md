S3RS is a command-line tool for S3 storage protocol.
This is also a side project when I working at Bigtera.
This agent provides basic S3 storage protocol both for CEPH and AWS.
The special feature is that can easy to switch with multiple config files.

S3RS now release a new feature in v0.2.8 is to let the user filter the object list from a bucket.  Following video demonstrate this new feature.

As you can see, there are thousands of test files in a bucket.

By using S3RS, you can easily show the objects with this prefix.
