## PAY  
> An ordering system

There are so may great but small restaurant in Taiwan, people need to line up for ordering. I want to solve this problem by using RPi2. When the RPi2 connect to the wifi ap and power up, the display shows the IP, which directs to a web application. From the web application, the store manager can easily print out QR codes and paste these codes on tables. Thus, customers can easily order meals by scanning the QR codes. The most different thing between the POS system is that people can use their own device to order meals. Besides, the project is open source, so it is easy to maintain and customize by themself.
